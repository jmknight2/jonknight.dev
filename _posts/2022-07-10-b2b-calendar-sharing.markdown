I recently came across a unique situation where one of our product teams had contracted with a 3rd party vendor for some project management staff augmentation. Since the teams were regularly working very closely together, scheduling meetings had become a hassle. We've all been a part of those dreaded email threads where everyone spouts off their availability in hopes of finding an overlapping timeslot. It's not ideal, to say the least. Since the 3rd party contractor was also using Office365, I thought this could be an excellent chance to try Office365's B2B calendar sharing. In this post, I'll discuss the features of calendar sharing and my implementation process.

### Overview

So first off, what does calendar sharing actually do? Well, in short, it allows you to share some (or all) of your organization's calendar availability with another organization. This is meant to ease collaboration between the two tenants, without being directly connected.
